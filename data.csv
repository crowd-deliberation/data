deliberation-sarcasm,19181,breadth,"Product: Gravis Eliminator AfterShock Rumble Game Pad  USB (G48031) (Electronics)Review Title: ""Complete Garbage...""I bought this before reading the reviews, which is unlike me.  Once I saw the experiences the other buyers had had, I was nervous, but convinced myself that it would be fine.  I run XP, so I downloaded the software from the Gravis site, installed everything, and tried a game.  The D pad wouldn't work, despite the fact that I had downloaded the XP software.  If this had been the only problem, I would have figured that I had just done something wrong, but the joysticks were awful!  Half the time, I would move the joystick up, to move forward, and when I released it my character kept going forward.  Not great when you're standing on the edge of a cliff.  I found it impossible to get any kind of control over my game characters, not nearly enough to even consider being able to use the gamepad for games.  Another thing about the gamepad is that, although I tried it in the store, to get a feel for it, I decided rather quickly that, regardless of how it worked, it just wasn't right for my small hands (I'm female, and have exceptionally small hands).  I can't call this a complaint, just a matter of personal preference.  When I viewed the ""Read Me"" file on this thing, and came to the section about ""Known Bugs"", I about had a heart attack at all of the problems this thing is ""known"" to have!  After every single bug listed, they gave a completely lame, unsatisfactory ""solution"".  For instance, one bug said that games often take a moment to respond to input from the controller.  Their solution? ""Please wait a moment after each button click, to give the game time to respond"".  Erm, sure; I'll just politely ask 200 Orcs to stop attacking me while Aragorn takes a moment to respond, no problem.  I'm not by any means an extremely serious gamer with unrealistically high expectations for my equipment; I just like to play sometimes, and want moderately sufficient results.  This controller came nowhere near that, and I'll be returning it tomorrow morning, after only owning it for about 18 hours.",

That describes ""New Moon"" perfectly.  The first Twilight film was tolerable. Slow moving, a little flat, but tolerable. Instead of moving things to a new level, New Moon wallows in the same somber material that was in the first film. But this time, girls, there are boys with no shirts = werewolves! How exciting? No, not really -  especially when there is so much maudlin dialog spread throughout this film.  I have to give credit to the marketing people and the producers. They managed to create something that can directly tap into the pre-teen, teen female movie-goer. Guys know, sensitivity is a hard thing to fake, but if you fake it well then you, just like this film,  will be real popular with the ladies. The romantic mythology of this age group is a very powerful thing and this film carefully harnesses that energy, generating massive ticket sales.   But is the film deserving of such attention? No, its not well made, the acting is boring and bad and the movie is unintentially funny. Lets hope this fad dies a quick death.",

deliberation-sarcasm,19188,breadth,"Product: The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max (DVD)Review Title: ""Disappointing workout DVD""People, this DVD is NOT for anyone who is already active and is less than 20 lbs. overweight. I bought this because it seemingly had three 20-minute cardio segments and I thought I'd get a great cardio workout. NOT. In the 1st segment, the instructor is primarily running his mouth (in an attempt to motivate) and not really participating much in the actual routine. All you see is several blubbery, out of shape, out of breath flabby folks who cannot stay in unison or use proper technique to save their lives. The viewer is left with a mish-mash of poor technique and a flamboyant instructor running his mouth (and hovering around the ""boys""). This may be a helpful start for those who have never worked out in their lives and who are 75 lbs OR MORE overweight but for those of us who've been moderate-to extremely active and have less than 20-30 lbs. to lose, you may not find this DVD useful on any level. I am used to seeing in-shape and toned bodies on my workout DVD's, providing a VISUAL GOAL for myself. Right? Why would someone who is hoping to drop a few lbs want to see grossly out-of-shape folks on their TV screen? I give them props for getting off their bottoms and trying to get healthy. But I truly recommend this DVD to the extremely overweight and inactive. The other 2 segments at least have the instructors working out (more than the 1st instructor) but the routines are low-cardio and mundane. And of course, the group is way out of unison.  *I was aware that the Biggest Loser cast was in the video; I just didn't realize they'd be so awful and pathetic. Sorry for the unkind words.",

On the other hand, it's only fair that I point out that I've seen the comic book version and it's perfectly suited for that medium, it works much better in that form.

It was so cool looking and easy to manuver.  I eagerly turned on the machine and made a few easy strokes..... huh? Something must be wrong.  It didn't even erase the footprints in the carpet and the suction was ok at best.  I switched off the brush bar and looked in the end, nothing was wrong.  I called customer service and after about 15 minutes on the phone with them figured out it was working properly. What the heck? I expected this thing to suck so hard that it would lift the carpet and create perfecty groomed rows of nap...like a freshly plowed field.  Not even close it barely even combed the top of the fibers.  Problem #1-No height adjustment for the brush bar.  It barely even touches the carpet.  Not enough to even give you that ""just vacuumed"" look.  Talk about a suction leak. Problem #2-It doesn't have very good sucking power.  My old Bissel sucked 2x as hard as this dyson.  Even the guy on the customer care line said it only moved about 50CFM of air compared to my old vacuum that moved much much more.   Don't belive the marketing hype.  It's not worth the money.  Ever wonder why consumer reports ranks the cleaning ability of the Dyson as average?  Because it is.  Consumer reports is dead on in their review.  It's just not that good of a cleaner. Sure it looks cool and you can park it in the driveway to impress your neighbors... but as far as cleaning my carpets, this vacuum sucks - Not in a good way.

deliberation-sarcasm,19211,breadth,"Product: Can You Keep a Secret? (Hardcover)Review Title: ""If  you thought the TV show Friends was FABULOUS, you'll love this....""But if not, you'll be bored silly by this book. I know I was. I've rarely stopped reading a book before reaching the end, but I was sooo close with this one. The only reason I kept reading was because of all the 5 star ratings I saw here. I thought, surely, it must get better. It has to! I was waiting for all the 'laugh out loud' moments that everyone was talking about but they never appeared. My advice: if you're not laughing away midway through, abandon ship! It doesn't get any better. In fact it gets worse.  To be honest, I tend to read more serious stuff. I've read a couple really great 'chick lit' books but this one really falls short.  I picked it up at the library  in search of a quick light read. I didn't find it such a quick read because I just couldn't get into it. And yes, it's light but really dull and well, for me anyway, boring.  Where do I start with what I disliked about this book? The characters are flimsy caricatures -- completely unbelievable and they're all so irritatingly thick. The dialogue never really goes anywhere. Emma has this completely irritating habit of starting every other sentence with ""er, uh, um...."" Whatever laughs there are are so belaboured that they're just not funny anymore. For instance, the big scene where Jack spews all of Emma's secrets & her colleagues respond in shock to every single darned one goes on for some 4 pages ('You're really a size  6?' 'You have a  Barbie bedspread?' 'You hate crochet?' bla bla bla...) Boy, funny stuff. You already know what all of them are anyway, so there's just no sense of suspense or tension. And in general, you know what's going to happen ages before it does, so as I was reading I kept thinking 'oh come on, get on with it already!' I found the writing style just plain flat and uninspiring. There's just no depth of any kind. Worst of all, the plot line is so contrived.  I completely get why Emma would think she was 'madly' in love with Jack after just a couple dates but what's Jack's deal? Are we really supposed to believe that some multi-millionaire CEO would fall in love with this ditzy, dim junior employee who is easily what, 20 years his junior? Riiiight. And Jack's 'big secret'? Now THAT made me laugh because it was just soo silly! And the sappy ending? Yuck!  Sorry, I just could not recommend this one unless you were shipwrecked on an deserted island with absolutely positively nothing else to do and even then, maybe not. I truly am baffled by all the rave reviews here. It reads more like a teen novel than something for adults --  very, very, very sophmoric. Anyway, you get the point. I really didn't like it.   I would, however, like to recommend 2 other chick lit books that surpass this one by miles. The Other Side of the  Story by Marian Keyes is an incredibly witty, smart, sparkly, genuine laugh-out-loud book. I couldn't  put it down and although it's long, I was disappointed when I was done because I wanted more. Girl's Poker Night by Jill Davis is another very funny, very bright book. Both of these books are everything I think this one hoped to be.",

Sookie sighing over Eric, Sookie unsure of where she stands with Bill, something or other about Alcide and the werewolves, dealing with a suspicious fairy triplet, and so on and so forth.  None of it serves a purpose.  This is always a problem authors face when they're forced to extend a series once it becomes successful: the overlapping of characters and subplots become so overwhelming that they don't know what to do with them.  Laurell K. Hamilton, Jim Butcher and Kelley Armstrong suffer from the same thing.  It's time for Ms. Harris to put this series to rest.  Now that Alan Ball has adapted this story for the HBO series, I am actually enjoying that more than the books.  All I can do is thank Harris for writing this, for the TV series wouldn't exist if she hadn't started this.

deliberation-sarcasm,19250,breadth,"Product: The Da Vinci Code (Mass Market Paperback)Review Title: ""NOT LITERATURE, BUT A GREAT BUSINESS MODEL""I hear this novel has sold over 6,000,000 copies.  Mr. Brown is no doubt pleased, and loses little sleep over the possibility that in six years no one will be reading his blockbuster.  He has his villa on the Riviera, if he wants it.  I do not wish to disparage his talents.  Suppose you wish to write such a novel and have in mind several characters.  Character A (a handsome American, by the way)is perhaps the world's leading authority on, say, symbolism.  Character B (beautiful by the way) is a brilliant young French cryptologist.  Character C (incredibly wealthy and charming)is an eccentric old English peer who happens to have spent his entire life studying early Christian exotica, including secret societies and the legend of the Holy Grail.  Fate throws them together one dark and stormy night in Europe.  The action is precipitated by character D, a hulking religious albino homicidal maniac who wears a monk's robe and favors barbed wire garters.  He is a (fictitious) postulant in service to Opus Dei (God's work), an arch-conservative semi-secret Catholic sect that is obviously up to no good --desiring, as they do, to crank the wayward church of today back a thousand years or so to when Christians really knew how to suffer. D is not the villain, by the way, and his passion for slaying is excused by the fact that when a kid, other kids teased him about his size and lack of pigmentation.  Okay, now you have four highly original characters, and an opening sequence in which, it turns out, several perfectly nice and distinguished old fellows are murdered by the monk.    Where do you go now?  Well, in this enlightened age, you know how readers love books that moon religion, and especially if the moon-ee is the once venerable but now scandalized Catholic Church.  But you can't just make stuff up, at least not all of it, so you have to do some hard work called research, or hire someone to do it.  What you dig up does not have to be entirely true, as long as it is interesting, especially if it is a little titillating to one's baser instincts.  History being what it is, and humans being who we are, you will discover a number of unsavory truths mixed in with a larger number of equally unsavory untruths, rumors, suspicions, legends, and valid questions.  As a creative person endowed with artistic license, you may crayola some of these tidbits to make them even more delicious, if not salacious. This is called ""mining the vein of history.""  If you are diligent and blessed with a certain intelligence, you will, out of this stew of possibles, come up with a substory that is so gripping, so bizarre, so full of lust and corruption that few will not want to hear of it.  More work is ahead, for your true genius is revealed in how you plot the story.  When is ""fact"" X, hinted at or revealed, and by whom or what?  Character A knows much, but not enough; enter character B, to complement A's knowledge.  Even the two are still insufficient (although they are falling in love).  Alas, even the vast erudition of C leaves us wanting.  Read on!  Read on!   Maybe, dear reader, after I don't know how many hundreds of pages, you get tired of the author's continuously advancing carrot and you flip to the final pages to find the final answer.  Then you might wish to turn to another novel about real people in a real world, such as A month in the Country, by J. L. Carr",

I'm a sci-fi geek through and through, from all the Star Treks, both BSG's, all the Stargates, Babylon 5 (and it's ill-fated spinoff Crusade), I'm usually cool with anything in space.  But my god.  Ridiculous? Awful? Cause of severe eye-bleeding? I'm not sure how I can really describe this show.  I probably even managed to make it through half the episodes without knowing or caring who was doing what before I gave up and sold it on here to some poor misguided soul. The acting is bad.  So is the writing.  And the western style is absurd.  Why in the H would people redevelop western accents?  Is the medieval British accent making a comeback? The whole thing is just a complete waste of a show.",

The Tuohys should be commended and I am glad they made the film to bring awareness to that. I do like Sandra in it, but was it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. (as a comparison Julia Roberts' performance as Erin Brockovich was far superior) And to put that little kid front and center like that through the whole thing with his over-acting was a total distraction, unrealistic, and annoying. He was the Jar-Jar Binks of the movie for sure. And riiiiiiiiight...this little kid coached Mike making him the great football player that he is because a first grader knows more about football than any real coach does. Sure. Whatever. And TIM MCGRAW in a lead role? Who came up with that idea? Something tells me he didn't show up at the casting call and beat out everyone else out because he's a better actor than all the real actors out there. He's a country western SINGER with NO acting experience (or ability) as I found out from watching this movie. I also find it HARD to believe that she would just be able to yell at some bigoted redneck in the stands and drug dealers and have NO consequences for that at all. Yeah, I'm gonna drive my 7-Series BMW to the drug-dealer hang out, get out dressed in diamonds and expensive clothes and threaten drug dealers who kill people on a regular basis all by myself, get in all of their faces and tell them I have a gun in my $800 Gucci bag and just shut them all down verbally because I'm just ALL THAT?

deliberation-sarcasm,19260,breadth and depth,"Product: The Fame (Audio CD)Review Title: ""Success does not equal quality!!""Try, if you can, to put to one side GaGa's irritating self-obsession and her ridiculous delusion that she's somehow in on a 'party' and is 'sharing it' with us lowly non-famous people, and let's look at the album on it's own merits. Surely it can't be THAT bad, right? She has credentials, after all. She's worked with some respectable collaborators, after all. She can hold a note, after all.  Sadly, none of this seems to have counted for much at all. What we have here is the very worst pop sludge, making it's ugly way off the predictable, unoriginal treadmill of weak pop music and into the mindset of the hysterical masses, whose purchases and subsequent success of that which they purchase fool both consumer and artist alike into attributing far more quality to a product like this than it actually warrants.  Put simply, this is rubbish. Over indulgent, shallow and completely inconsequential rubbish of the kind we'll look back at in five years time and wonder what on earth so many people were thinking by buying it in large quantities. Presumably GaGa knows this already, hence her insistence on dribbling out barely coherent concepts of her fans being 'part of her lifestyle' (as if it's in any way desirable), and distracting us by flashing her body as if it adds anything other than something most women will cringe at and be rightly embarssed for her about.  Given her past contacts, this really is unforgivable tripe. Its success is no justification for it's supposed quality. We all know that if the sheep are spoon-fed something and told it's good by radio stations and celebrity magazines, they'll inevitably lap it up thoughtlessly. Given how many artists are actually putting out decent music that gets overlooked because some trumped up nobody with favourable contacts and a good body puts out garbage like this, it's a real tragedy that everything other than quality seems to be the criteria that measures success.",
